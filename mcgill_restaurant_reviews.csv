The colourful exterior was a pleasant surprise. Inside, it is elegant, but still comfortable. Dinner and breakfast at the restaurant were very memorable, and worth repeating soon.

Cool wallpaper in the bathroom as well.",Nadine Robinson,2025-11-17T00:53:45.317855612Z,5.0,"Great location — but what really sets this place apart is the atmosphere. It manages to blend cozy comfort with a luxury feel, which is surprisingly rare. You get that warm, intimate vibe, but with high-end details that still make it feel special and upscale.

The hotel is extremely clean. Not just “fine,” but genuinely spotless and well cared for. Rooms, linens, bathrooms, hallways — everything felt fresh, tidy, and thoughtfully maintained. Huge plus if you notice these things like we do.

Check-in was fast and easy. No long waits, no confusion — efficient and smooth from start to finish. Staff clearly know what they’re doing, and it shows.

Perfect for a couple’s weekend. If you're looking for somewhere stylish, clean, romantic, and stress-free, this is a great pick. We honestly left impressed.

The staff is professional and offered exceptional service. The classic queen room I stayed in was so comfortable and I felt relaxed the entire stay. The bedding was perfect, and the windows almost completely soundproof. I’m a light sleeper and am easily awakened by noise (especially from cars). I didn’t have that issue at Le Germain. The location is PERFECT. It’s a quick walk to 2 metro stations and the trails of Mont Royal.

Also, random, but the shampoo and soap they provide are absolutely amazing. I have sensitive skin and usually can’t use hotel toiletries, but whatever brand they’re using is super high quality. It also smells sooooo good I wish I had bought some to take home. I’d stay here again and again.",Brian T,2025-10-23T14:29:08.530300902Z,3.0,"Hôtel Le Germain Montréal has always been our default hotel for business trips, and honestly, that’s its saving grace. The location is fantastic—super easy to get to, and you can access everything downtown quickly. The service is always nice, and the staff are generally great.

However, my stay from Oct 20-22 was a real disappointment, and if it was a personal trip, I'd be looking elsewhere, sorry!

The Room Was TINY: I've stayed here before and had normal rooms. This last one was ridiculously small. The entrance doorway was so tight it felt like I was squeezing in and the door will almost hit the bathroom wall.

Major Stench in the Bathroom: This was the worst part. The little room with the toilet smelled absolutely foul. We tried everything—spraying perfume, opening the door—but the stink just overpowered it. I'm pretty sure the exhaust fan was totally broken because the smell never cleared. That’s a huge issue for cleanliness.

Fishy Lobby? Even the main lobby had a weird, almost fishy smell to it. It was pretty off-putting right when you walk in.

I hope management sees this because the hotel's location is perfect for business, but the room quality and the smell issues on this recent visit were a huge letdown. If the hotel wasn't so convenient for work, I wouldn't book it again.",Neil Santos,2025-10-24T21:18:05.102051068Z

Portions are on the smaller side for big eaters, and the wait for onigiri can be a little slow, but overall it’s a pleasant place for a satisfying meal.

I don’t recommend the beef rice, though—the meat portions weren’t generous, and the accompanying salad came without any dressing, which made it feel a bit lacking.",Di L,2025-10-01T01:38:17.736710442Z,4.0,"Visited a few times for their matcha drinks.

Pigeon salad was good but falafel was a huge let down. A bit hard and didn’t taste fresh. For $6 that they charge for falafel alone, I would expect much much better.

This is a busy location, and they handle it as best as possible. Overall, I really like coming here as part of my routine, and I like seeing familiar faces.

Most recently, there was an incident where somebody walked off with my food before I got to the counter, but Ami was super sweet and attentive. She immediately offered to remake my order and apologized for it. I wouldn’t blame them for someone else’s actions. I did one of their guest surveys, and they really listen to their customers here. This isn’t the first time I’ve written something and they take my feedback to heart.

I recently spoke with the manager, Roaksana, and she did her best to make things right.

Set inside the Sofitel hotel this place is best described as a culinary experience. The chef plays with flavors and textures using unique flavors without overpowering you into submission.

It’s a subtle dance, teasing and flirting until you fall in love. We ordered the sea water jelly, foie gras, Canadian pike lobster bisque to start with the Chef D’otel, duck breast, pasta with porcini mushrooms and a kids Salmon.

Let’s start with the miso bread!  Holy smokes it was delicious. Kids salmon is well portioned and they have this decadent orange sauce. Great crust and moist. Sea water jelly with lobster was out of this world. Foie gras was buttery and their brioche was light and fluffy. The duck breast and pasta were good but the star was the Chef d’otel which came with a lobster bisque, a cod which were divine! Never had anything like it. Flavors were subtle and complex highlighting textures and colors.

Don’t sleep on the dessert. Like the meal they were uniquely refreshing and fun. Our family including two young daughters gobbled everything up and we were stuffed!

I had a Manhattan cocktail to start and if it was any indication, the cherry was very not your run of the mill.

Best way to describe our experience was a curated collection of wonderful ingredients. Service was friendly, engaging and prompt. We felt catered too and celebrating my mom’s birthday with a sparkler on her dessert.

Well….. yes some parts of Renoir were great like the server we had was nice, polite and took to our every need, but I don’t know if she was fairly new because I found she did not know her menu very well. The atmosphere was nice, well cleaned and not so loud. We could talk to each other without yelling which was nice. Now brings me to the food. Now I love food, and no I’m not a professional food connoisseur, but I do work in a kitchen and feel I know what people are looking for, well I know what I am looking for. Let’s start with the appetizers and the amuse bouch. A corn soupish with edible flowers and some crunchy things was tasty and worth having again. Very flavourful and not too big as to fill you for your appetizers and meal. Next the appetizer, Quebec’s tomato gazpacho ricotta espuma with basil oil. This was by far the best thing I ate at Renoir. The flavour and aroma was on point. First time I ate gazpacho and now I’m hooked, so thank you for that. Then comes the main course. Let’s just say after eating the gazpacho I was a little disappointed. The amount of food for the price. Yes it was duck and sure I expected to pay a bit more for duck but what I received was surprisingly small. So then you expect it to be amazing in flavour, well sorry to disappoint you it was just ok. And what’s up with the leaf roll. I found does not match the story going on the plate. So let’s move to dessert. If I understand correctly they have a baker in the kitchen and the cakes are made in house. I ordered the pistachio cake, very nice light and tasty. Has raspberry inside. Very good.

I placed a pickup order at 11:50, and only received it at 12:20, meaning I waited about 20 minutes past the pickup time. At one point, there was even confusion about my order being cancelled, which may have caused a small delay — but even taking that into account, the wait felt excessive for a simple smoothie and a salad that is usually pre-prepared. Knowing this cafe in its other locations, I know it is not normal. Because of this delay, I ended up missing an appointment.

What was especially frustrating is that customers who ordered at the counter after me were served almost immediately, while my prepaid pickup order seemed to be overlooked. For a café meant to be convenient and efficient for people grabbing something quickly, this really defeats the purpose of ordering ahead.

That said, I genuinely felt for the staff — they seemed very understaffed and overwhelmed, and it didn’t look like they were set up to handle rushes properly. I want to highlight Creation, who was very kind, helpful, and professional despite the situation. Unfortunately, the experience at the cash felt less helpful overall, even considering how busy it was.

It’s just unfortunate because this location is so well-situated and has the potential to be a great grab-and-go spot, but if service continues to be this slow, it becomes impractical to stop by.

I really hope this location improves its organization and pickup order process, because Spirulina has always been a go-to for me, and I’d love to see this location meet the same standard as the others.",Patricia Almeida,2026-01-07T17:26:31.920580354Z,5.0,"Amazing place that has healthy and delicious food for brunch or breakfast.

More on what I mean: there is no elevator to rooms on the upper floors (3). Check in is at the cafe downstairs and the key comes in a worn out envelope that doesn't seem to have been changed in years. The room itself was spare and old but clean, and the bathroom was new. The linens were worn (the pillowcase had a hole in it) and hallways and common areas were pretty stark. The wifi didn't work.

I ended up checking out early and they didn't offer a refund, which is 100% their priority but aligns with the general lack of understanding of customer service here.",Annex Mama,2025-10-27T18:47:38.147091747Z,1.0,"I stayed at Hotel Ambrose for 3 nights, and while the building has charm, my experience with management was nothing short of a mess — the kind of stress you don’t expect when you’re simply trying to enjoy a trip.
I booked my stay a month in advance, relying on their website’s very clear promise: “book now, pay later.” It also stated that my card would only be charged 24 hours before arrival. But instead of following their own policy, they charged me the moment I booked — instantly, without warning.
This wasn’t just annoying. It caused real inconvenience because the card I used was already tied up with another expense at the time. That early charge threw everything off… and instead of helping, management made the situation ten times worse.
When I reached out for clarification, the responses I received were shockingly rude and cold. On the phone and over email, the attitude was the same: dismissive, unprofessional, and sounding like they couldn’t care less about the impact their mistake had on me. No apology. No accountability. Not even basic courtesy. Just attitude.
The stay itself was fine, but the way management handled this issue left me genuinely frustrated. A small problem turned into a full-blown ordeal because the people in charge couldn’t be bothered to treat a guest with respect — or to follow the policy they posted online.
Hotel Ambrose may look cozy and welcoming on the outside, but the way they treat guests behind the scenes is a completely different story. If you value honesty, transparency, and customer service that doesn’t make you feel like you’re an inconvenience, I’d seriously reconsider booking here.",Babal kaler,2025-12-02T02:11:12.012655796Z

We politely asked if it was possible to rearrange them, but the waiter immediately refused in a very unapproachable manner.
The worst part happened when one of my students approached her to ask something. Before he could even speak, she shouted “NO, THE FINAL ANSWER IS NO!.” We didn’t even know what he was going to say. This was especially upsetting because the student did not say anything at all. The lack of professionalism and empathy shown toward him was shocking.
I was not the only one who noticed this behavior. Several of us, including postdocs and PhD students, were very disturbed by the way she handled the situation. It reflected zero professionalism and no respect toward the student and myself..

Their poutine is worth a mention. We ordered hotdog poutine, the fries were delightfully crispy, and they were generous with the cheese. The only small downside is it can be a bit on the salty side, but overall, it's a good choice.

Best for student, and tourists on a budget that are looking for a cool cheap place to eat for lunch. This place is by far the best place to eat on McGill campus. Their business model is very simple: they have sandwiches (4$) and vermicelli bowls (7$), and you choose your meat. They also have rolls, salads and buns, a lot of different snacks I had never tried before and two full fridges stocked with awesome beverages (basil seed beverages, coconut water,  soy-based drinks, all the juices, Mexican Jarritos, some sort of Créole drink and so many other that I can't even describe). Overpriced, mediocre food has been the only option for lunch in every cafeteria in downtown campus for far too long, not anymore! Vinh's is simply amazing, the food is delicious I could eat it everyday, it is so fresh the cook was cutting a cucumber for my order in front of me today, the staff is so nice and is it so affordable! These people are heroes, saving the poor student from a lifetime of eating terrible overpriced food on campus. I remember starving myself as an undergrad when I didn't have time to come home for lunch, because I was broke as hell I couldn't afford any food on campus, and I didn't have time to meal prep.

The Food and Beverage are excellent, the variety is great.
The place is clean, proper, well arranged, always well maintained.
People are served fast and with great professionalism.
The Customer service behind the counter, like Mr Aman for example, are very helpful and very customer caring, he and his colleagues always go the extra mile to satisfy every customer desire and they try to improve every day. That is why this restaurant is as of the highest quality among all the rest of the Tim Horton's locations.

It is always fresh inside, agreeable atmosphere. The friendliness and the easy understanding with the Customer service makes you feel welcome immediately.
They take private orders and it does not take long for them to prepare them.
The highly maintained hygiene helps attracting even customers that have very high standards about going to a restaurant.
Every time I have been going there I come, enjoy my stay, and leave with a smile inside my heart.
They allow you to feel relaxed without pressuring you to choose.
Plus this place operates 24 hours. Whether a late night latte or an early morning espresso, or a lunch - you have it all there.
I totally recommend it and I absolutely give 5 stars for this place and its team. From the owner to the newest customer service representative.
Mr. Aman had assisted me in various occasions with private orders and he had been extremely nice and helpful about it.

Details:
• Toilet: FILTHY. The bowl is caked in ancient grime, stains, and waste. The stench is overpowering.
• The Sink/Counter: ABSOLUTELY APPALLING. There was visible, fresh or semi-dried blood splattered on the sink basin and counter. This is deeply upsetting, dangerous, and a sign of absolute, catastrophic neglect.
• Overall Condition: The room looks like a scene of a medical emergency or a violent accident that has been left completely unattended.
• Risk Level: Extremely High. Avoid contact with any surface. This facility should be shut down immediately and professionally sanitized.

The music was excellent throughout the night, which encouraged me to stay until closing, an experience I haven't had in a few years.

Regarding the pricing of beverages, I must admit I found the cost of individual drinks and shots to be somewhat high. For those planning to enjoy more than a couple of drinks, it might be more economical to consider purchasing a bottle.

I am from Niagara Falls Ontario I was visiting Montreal my WHOLE trip got ruined I had to take a flight back next day!

On November 28 2025 I was inside SOUBOIS around 2Am - 3Am. During an argument in the bathroom, police officers arrived and used pepper spray on me and many other women and bystanders in a closed indoor bathroom. I and at least 10 other women — including customers, staff, bartenders — were immediately affected.I suffered severe burning in my eyes, temporary loss of vision, pain on my face from glass/wounds, and respiratory distress. I was taken to hospital but was not properly treated or examined. I was served roughly and not given meaningfully immediate care. The use of pepper spray under those conditions was reckless and disproportionate.

Damages / Effects: Eye pain and burning; temporary vision issues; physical and emotional trauma; stress; abandonment by friends; hospital bills / medical distress; fear; ongoing anxiety.Why I believe police misconduct occurred: The use of pepper spray was excessive, indiscriminate, and reckless, given there was no violent threat from all individuals; many innocent people were harmed; the environment was a closed indoor bathroom; the response lacked de-escalation; there was no adequate medical response or decontamination.

I am back home now trying to file a compliant with cops . The cops from Montreal are absolutely disgusting and use brutality. They abuse their power .

The shakshuka was rich and hearty, with perfectly poached eggs in a vibrant tomato sauce topped with fresh arugula. It came with a side of crisp toast and fresh fruit — a refreshing balance to the warm, savory flavors.

The croissant breakfast sandwich was equally impressive — flaky, buttery pastry enveloping fluffy eggs, melted cheese, and peppery greens, paired with fresh strawberries and melon.

The atmosphere was modern and inviting, with plenty of natural light and comfortable seating. The service was attentive, warm, and genuinely welcoming, adding to the relaxed, enjoyable dining experience.

The baingan had whole cloves and cardamom, which overpowered the dish when I bit into them, and it ruined the meal for me, whole spices should be removed before serving. The garlic naan tasty, but the poppadoms were chewy instead of crisp. Delivery arrived nicely packed via Uber Eats.",Dr Shaz,2025-10-19T03:06:08.855059666Z,3.0,"Le Taj offers a beautifully warm and elegant atmosphere, with vintage Indian décor that creates an inviting and authentic setting. Service was professional and attentive, and the ambiance alone sets a high expectation for the dining experience.

We opted for the ""feast"" menu, which included a salad, appetizer, main with a vegetarian side, and dessert. The cucumber and tomato salad was refreshing, if a bit oversized. My fish appetizer was flat in flavor and oddly textured, though my partner’s papdi chaat was crisp, tangy, and truly excellent.

For mains, the butter chicken had perfectly cooked meat, but the sauce lacked the depth, spice, and balance expected from such a signature dish. My partner’s lamb vindaloo, however, was a standout - bold, rich, spicy, and deeply satisfying. On the side, the paneer masala had a beautifully balanced tomato-based sauce, while the saag paneer was watery and underseasoned. The naan was exceptional, and the basmati rice decent, though a bit soft.

Desserts were pleasant but unremarkable - gulab jamun was as expected, and a milk-based paneer dessert was unique but not particularly memorable.

The low point of the evening was unquestionably the cocktails. At $20 each, both the mango mojito and mango martini were disappointing - overly sweet, poorly balanced, and lacking noticeable alcohol & technique. They tasted more like juice than proper cocktails, which felt out of step with the overall experience and definitely a disappointment.

In summary, for the overall modest cost (about $120 per person), the experience was fair - beautiful ambiance, attentive service, and a few excellent dishes made it worthwhile. Still, based on its 4.2-star rating and reputation, we expected a bit more across the board. We've enjoyed more flavorful meals at lesser-known Indian restaurants, and with a few refinements - particularly in the cocktails and consistency of dishes - Le Taj could truly shine.

While the restaurant itself merits a solid 4 stars, the cocktails were disappointing enough to bring the overall experience down a notch to 3 stars. Fix the cocktails.",Sébastien Roy,2025-07-24T03:10:30.105761715Z

I ordered the lunch special with the assortment makis, and my husband chose the sashimi, nigiri, and maki platter lunch special. Both lunch specials came with miso soup, which was comforting and well done.

We also ordered O-toro (fatty tuna) and itoyori (threadfin bream) sashimi, and these were absolutely exquisite and hands down some of the best quality fish we’ve had. The freshness, texture, and flavor really stood out and made the meal feel special.

Bad aspects:
Ordering was like being in the twilight zone. I am a girl who knows what she wants but is also able to compromise. Neither of that happened for me. Our group was missing spicy mayo, drinks, a full burger, and randomly missing a bunch of standard condiments. The staff was helpful when we went to ask for these things again after sitting down but it took too much brain power to get a close-enough version of
what we ordered. Our orders were relatively basic but did have some normal requests (ie please add spicy mayo, please none of this condiment, etc).

Anyways I’ll be back",Lauren F,2024-11-10T07:00:43.064347Z,1.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This was by far the most appalling fast-food experience I’ve ever had.

First, they messed up our order—not a small mistake, but completely wrong. When we tried to politely point it out, instead of fixing the issue, the employee actually yelled at us as though it was somehow our fault that they couldn’t get a simple order right. The arrogance and lack of accountability were shocking.

To make matters worse, when our food finally did come out, it was prepared poorly and clearly rushed. Everything looked sloppy, tasted off, and was nowhere near A&W’s usual standard.

The absolute worst part was the rudeness. We were treated with hostility from start to finish, as if customers daring to expect the correct food were an inconvenience. Fast food service isn’t fine dining, but basic respect and decency should not be too much to ask.

A&W should be ashamed to have staff representing their brand this way. We left feeling disrespected, hungry, and disgusted by the whole ordeal.

The foam is wrong and she just throws the milk in there without any good method/barista technique . Complaining is not my thing but the ladies that work there do not like/know how to make coffee nor are they ever friendly . Kinda sad experience when you just want a pick me up nice cup of capuccino.

However, my stay from Oct 20-22 was a real disappointment, and if it was a personal trip, I'd be looking elsewhere, sorry!

The Room Was TINY: I've stayed here before and had normal rooms. This last one was ridiculously small. The entrance doorway was so tight it felt like I was squeezing in and the door will almost hit the bathroom wall.

Major Stench in the Bathroom: This was the worst part. The little room with the toilet smelled absolutely foul. We tried everything—spraying perfume, opening the door—but the stink just overpowered it. I'm pretty sure the exhaust fan was totally broken because the smell never cleared. That’s a huge issue for cleanliness.

Fishy Lobby? Even the main lobby had a weird, almost fishy smell to it. It was pretty off-putting right when you walk in.

I hope management sees this because the hotel's location is perfect for business, but the room quality and the smell issues on this recent visit were a huge letdown. If the hotel wasn't so convenient for work, I wouldn't book it again.",Neil Santos,2025-10-24T21:18:05.102051068Z

We ordered the onion soup, served with a rich cheesy topping — it was absolutely delicious. To be honest, after the soup alone I already felt full and completely satisfied😁
But we didn’t stop there and ordered a smoked meat sandwich. It was outstanding: a huge portion with incredibly juicy meat and wonderful bread, very soft inside with a crispy crust served with fries on the side🤤

Extremely well maintained establishment. However the food itself felt mediocre. Portion size of the kaiser sandwich was very disappointing and the meats were just okay. There was a subtle lack of attention to detail like placing the pickle on a hot plate just made for a warm pickle which isn’t very appetizing. Poutine was probably my favourite part of the meal. Also one awkward moment of the meal transpired where the server dropped a mayo pack on the floor but swiftly picked it up and tried to conceal her putting it back on the plate and served it to me right after. Extremely odd and somewhat disrespectful moment which I assume was a momentary lapse of judgement.

Every single item was made fresh to order, and you can *taste* the difference. The dosa was golden and crispy, the vada was flavorful and had great texture, and the idlis were pillowy and clearly homemade. The coconut chutney was so good, I asked for two extra servings—and they gave them to me free of charge, which just shows how generous and customer-focused the staff is.
